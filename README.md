I’m Szabi, I live in Romania with my wife and our beautiful 6 year old daughter Maya. I started my journey in WordPress plugin development in 2017, when I quit my programmer job and became a full time stay at home WordPress plugin developer,  entrepreneur, blogger and daddy. You can check my current WordPress plugin portfolio on my [CodeCanyon profile](https://1.envato.market/coderevolutionplugins).

I am fascinated by WordPress, the internet, computers and ways to earn an online passive income.
